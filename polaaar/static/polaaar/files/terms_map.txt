samplemetadata	source_mat_id	A unique identifier assigned to a material sample (as defined by http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/materialSampleID, and as opposed to a particular digital record of a material sample) used for extracting nucleic acids, and subsequent sequencing. The identifier can refer either to the original material collected or to any derived sub-samples. The INSDC qualifiers /specimen_voucher, /bio_material, or /culture_collection may or may not share the same value as the source_mat_id field. For instance, the /specimen_voucher qualifier and source_mat_id may both contain 'UAM:Herps:14' , referring to both the specimen voucher and sampled tissue with the same identifier. However, the /culture_collection qualifier may refer to a value from an initial culture (e.g. ATCC:11775) while source_mat_id would refer to an identifier from some derived culture from which the nucleic acids were extracted (e.g. xatc123 or ark:/2154/R2).
samplemetadata	submitted_to_insdc	Depending on the study (large-scale e.g. done with next generation sequencing technology, or small-scale) sequences have to be submitted to SRA (Sequence Read Archive), DRA (DDBJ Read Archive) or via the classical Webin/Sequin systems to Genbank, ENA and DDBJ.
